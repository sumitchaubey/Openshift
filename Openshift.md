curl: The command itself for making network requests.

-k: This option allows curl to perform the transfer even if the SSL certificate of the server cannot be verified. It's commonly used for testing or if you are certain about the source but the certificate is not trusted.

https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/ocp/$OCP_VERSION/openshift-client-linux.tar.gz: The URL from which the file will be downloaded. The $OCP_VERSION is a variable that should be defined in your shell environment, providing the version of OpenShift. Make sure to set it before running the command.

-o oc.tar.gz: This option specifies the output file name for the downloaded content. In this case, the downloaded file will be saved as oc.tar.gz.

So, when you run this command, it downloads the OpenShift client binary archive for the specified version and saves it as oc.tar.gz in the current working directory. After the download is complete, you can extract the contents of the archive and use the OpenShift client (oc) for managing OpenShift clusters.

```
[sumit_chaubey@sumit ocp]$ tar zxf oc.tar.gz
```
tar: The command for manipulating tar archives.

z: This option specifies that the archive is compressed with gzip.

x: This option tells tar to extract the contents of the archive.

f: This option is used to specify the archive file to work with.
 ```
 [sumit_chaubey@sumit ocp]$ chmod +x oc
```
chmod: The command for changing file permissions.

+x: This option adds the execute permission to the specified file.

oc: This is the name of the file for which you are modifying permissions. In this context, it's the OpenShift client executable.
```
[sumit_chaubey@sumit ocp]$  sudo cp oc /usr/bin
```
sudo: This is used to execute the command with superuser (root) privileges, as copying files to system directories often requires elevated permissions.

cp: This is the copy command.

oc: This is the source file (OpenShift client executable) that you want to copy.

/usr/bin: This is the destination directory where you want to copy the file. /usr/bin is a standard directory for executable files in many Linux distributions.

# This command is download Openshift Container Platform installer and make it available for use:

```
[sumit_chaubey@sumit ocp]$ curl -k https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/ocp/$OCP_VERSION/openshift-install-linux.tar.gz -o openshift-install-linux.tar.gz

curl: The command-line tool for making HTTP requests.

-k: This option allows curl to perform the transfer even if the SSL certificate of the server cannot be verified. It's commonly used for testing or if you are certain about the source but the certificate is not trusted.

https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/ocp/$OCP_VERSION/openshift-install-linux.tar.gz: The URL from which the file will be downloaded. The $OCP_VERSION is a variable that should be defined in your shell environment, providing the version of OpenShift. Ensure that you set it before running the command.

-o openshift-install-linux.tar.gz: This option specifies the output file name for the downloaded content. In this case, the downloaded file will be saved as openshift-install-linux.tar.gz.



```
 [sumit_chaubey@sumit ocp]$ tar zxvf openshift-install-linux.tar.gz
```
Output:

Openshift-install





tar: The command for manipulating tar archives.

z: This option specifies that the archive is compressed with gzip.

x: This option tells tar to extract the contents of the archive.

v: This option stands for "verbose," and it prints the names of the files being extracted to the terminal.

f: This option is used to specify the archive file to work with.



```
[sumit_chaubey@sumit ocp]$ chmod +x openshift-install
```
chmod: The command for changing file permissions.

+x: This option adds the execute permission to the specified file.

openshift-install: This is the name of the file for which you are modifying permissions. In this context, it's the OpenShift installer binary.


# Retrieve the RHCOS ISO URL by running the following command:

ISO_URL=$(./openshift-install coreos print-stream-json | grep location | grep $ARCH | grep iso | cut -d\" -f4)


./openshift-install: Executes the OpenShift installer binary.

coreos print-stream-json: This is an OpenShift installer command that prints CoreOS stream information in JSON format.

grep location: Filters lines that contain the word "location."

grep $ARCH: Further filters lines based on the value of the $ARCH variable. The $ARCH variable typically represents the architecture of the system (e.g., x86_64).

grep iso: Filters lines containing the word "iso."

cut -d\" -f4: Uses the cut command to extract the fourth field from each line, using the double quote (") as the delimiter. This is assuming that the URL is surrounded by double quotes.

ISO_URL=$(...): Assigns the extracted URL to the variable ISO_URL.

### Download the RHCOS ISO:

```
curl -L $ISO_URL -o rhcos-live.iso
```
curl: The command-line tool for making HTTP requests.

-L: This option tells curl to follow redirects. If the URL provided in $ISO_URL redirects to another location, -L ensures that curl follows the redirection.

$ISO_URL: This is the variable containing the URL of the CoreOS ISO file obtained in the previous step.

-o rhcos-live.iso: This option specifies the output file name for the downloaded content. In this case, the downloaded file will be saved as rhcos-live.iso.

sudo: This command is used to execute the following command with superuser (root) privileges. It's necessary for viewing detailed information about network connections and listening ports.

netstat: The main command for displaying network-related information.

-t: This option specifies that only TCP connections should be displayed.

-u: This option specifies that only UDP connections should be displayed.

-l: This option stands for "listening" and instructs netstat to display only listening sockets (ports that are actively waiting for incoming connections).

-n: This option specifies that the numeric form of addresses should be used (e.g., display port numbers as numbers instead of resolving them to service names).

-p: This option displays the process or program name associated with each network connection. It shows the PID (process ID) and the name of the program or service using the specified connection.
   	
### Change Directory:
```
[sumit_chaubey@sumit ocp]$ cd ..
```
```
[sumit_chaubey@sumit ocp]$ chmod +x install-config.yaml
```
chmod: This is the command used to change file permissions.

+x: This is the option specifying the permission to be added. In this case, it adds the execute permission.

install-config.yaml: This is the name of the file for which you are modifying permissions. In this context, it's the OpenShift installation configuration file.
```
[sumit_chaubey@sumit ocp]$ ll

## Run this command:
```[sumit_chaubey@sumit ocp]$ ./openshift-install --dir=ocp create single-node-ignition-config
```
Output: 

INFO Single-Node-Ignition-Config created in: ocp and ocp/auth

./openshift-install: Executes the OpenShift installer binary.

--dir=ocp: Specifies the directory (ocp) where the installation assets and configuration files are stored. This directory is often referred to as the installation directory.

create single-node-ignition-config: This is a command to create an ignition configuration file for a single-node OpenShift cluster. Ignition files are used during the initial bootstrap process to configure the machine and install the necessary components.


## Embed the ignition data into the RHCOS ISO by run this command:

```
[sumit_chaubey@sumit ocp]$ ali.as coreos-installer='podman run --privileged --pull always --rm -v /dev:/dev -v /run/udev:/run/udev -v $PWD:/data -w /data quay.io/coreos/coreos-installer:release'
```

```
[sumit_chaubey@sumit ocp]$ coreos-installer iso ignition embed -fi ocp/bootstrap-in-place-for-live-iso.ign rhcos-live.iso
```
Output:

 # Then create the vm those image is download for node:                                                                      	 
	

### Use this command in your bastion node
        ```
        ./openshift-install --dir=ocp wait-for install-complete
        ```
 ### You have to ssh vm 
 ```
        ssh -i ocokey  username@ip 
```
### Then check the log 
          journalctl  -x -f

 ### Wait 05 to 10 min while installation is complete



### While installation is completed you check your node  
```
      oc get node
```

## Then check the Cluster Operator they take a time to configure operator

```
 oc get co
```
